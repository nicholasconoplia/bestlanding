                <p>Hi, I'm the student who got tired of drowning in Canvas.</p>

                <p>Before I built Canvo, I was stuck in the same spiral as every overwhelmed student: checking Canvas 10 times a day, screenshotting assignments, juggling sticky notes, Notion boards, and alarms — and still missing deadlines.</p>

                <p>I thought there had to be something — something that just pulled everything I had to do into one clean to-do list, so I didn't have to hunt through modules and announcements and enter it all manually.</p>

                <p>It's 2025. Everything already exists, right?</p>

                <p>Nope. Not for me.</p>

                <p>So I spent hours searching. And when I couldn't find it… I built it.</p>

                <p>Canvo started during finals week — not because I had time, but because for once, I was finally ahead. I used my own early version to stay on track. It worked so well, I had enough breathing room to turn it into something real.</p>

                <p>Now it's not just mine — it's yours.</p>

                <p>Canvo is for every student who's ever felt like:</p>

                <div class="about-quotes">
                    <p>"I should be on top of things… but I'm always behind."</p>
                    <p>"I'm working hard — but still forgetting stuff."</p>
                    <p>"Everyone else looks organized, and I'm secretly drowning."</p>
                </div>

                <p>I built Canvo because I needed it. You get to use it because I refused to settle for feeling behind anymore.</p>

                <p>This isn't some VC-backed startup. It's one student, building for others who get it. No logins. No tracking. Just a tool that thinks like we do — and actually helps.</p>

                <p>You couldn't find this app before. But now, luckily for you — it exists.</p>

                <p>Let's finally feel on top of things — for real this time.</p>
