                    <div class="email-template">
                        <p><strong>To:</strong> canvas-support@university.edu<br>
                        <strong>Subject:</strong> Request for Canvas Access Token for Canvo App</p>

                        <p>Dear [IT Support / Canvas Administrator's Name],</p>

                        <p>I am a student at [Your University Name] and recently downloaded the Canvo app to help me stay organized with my coursework. I often find Canvas overwhelming and difficult to keep track of all my assignments, deadlines, and course information in one place.</p>

                        <p>Canvo promises to simplify this process by automatically organizing my tasks and deadlines, but it requires access to my Canvas access token. Unfortunately, I do not currently have access to generate an access token from my account.</p>

                        <p>I am requesting your assistance in enabling access token generation for my account so I can use Canvo to:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Automatically sync all my assignments, quizzes, and deadlines</li>
                            <li>Receive smart reminders and visual task calendars</li>
                            <li>Stay on top of my coursework and reduce stress</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>I understand that access token usage is subject to security and policy considerations. I want to assure you that:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>The app will only access data tied to my personal Canvas account</li>
                            <li>No third-party data will be collected or shared</li>
                            <li>The access token will be stored securely and used solely for academic purposes</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>If you have any questions about Canvo, you can visit canvo.vercel.app, contact support at canvohelp@gmail.com, or use the support page at canvo.vercel.app/support.</p>
